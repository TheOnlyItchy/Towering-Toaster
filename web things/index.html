        <a href="myFirst.html"> I think this is</a> <em>super intresting</em> and i really want to learn more about
        html, maybe even
        become a proficent html programer and advance beyoung a
        <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lifeguard">lifegaurd</a>
        , I think that would be a very
        intresting career path for me to take on.
    </p>

    <p>
        Furthermore It would also pay a lot more and be quite groovey, more money means more spending
        and lord knows It fun to buy things.
