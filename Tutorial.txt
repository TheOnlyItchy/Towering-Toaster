-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-

-INTRO-

    Infinitly randomly generated dungeon cralwer. each floor has a random amount of rooms
    with each room having a chance to be a battle, treasure room, or obstacle. there is no
    end goal objective beside beating your highscore and finding all the secrets.

-BATTLES-

    Your options in a battle are to attack, block, or grab. it works like rock paper scissors.

    Attack (rock) beats Grab (scissors)
    Grab (scissors) beats Block (paper)
    Block (paper) beats Attack (rock)

    the diffrence being that each attack has diffrent damage potential.

    -Attack
        Does the damage range of the weapon. Can crit (i.e.your weapons range is 5 - 9 damage. you will do a number inbetween that inclusive)

    -Grab
        Will ALWAYS have a base damage of 10, multipled by your player level. Can not crit (i.e. Your player level is 2, you do 20 damage)

    -Block
        Does the block damage of your weapon. Crits do 5x instead of 3x damage. (i.e. your block is 5, you do 5 damage)

-WEAPONs-

    Weapons have 4 important stats, Block, Attack, Level, and Crit Chance. block and attack are
    base unchanging numbers (Excluding crits). Weapon Level changes how strong your weapon is, unlike
    player level, you cannot level up your weapon. Crit chance is how often your weapon will deal a 
    critical. Critical attacks will deal x3 damage and critical blocks will deal 5x block damage.

        ---Example---
        Attack: 2 - 7
        Block: 3
        Level: 1
        Crit: 30%
        ------------

-Dungeon Floors-

    Each dungeon floor has a set ammount of rooms.

    -Battle Rooms-
        Will start a battle with a monster found on that floor Bosses will always be found in
         the last room of a floor and have a increased level.

    -Treasure Rooms-
        Treasure rooms will always have a new weapon for you, your choice weather
         you want it or not.

    -Obstacle Rooms-
        Obstacle rooms give you a choice that can affect anything about your charecter
         positive or negative. Just cause you encouter the same room twice doesnt mean that the same
        choice will always be the right one.

-Player/Creatures-

    Players have 4 important stats, Level, Health, Name, Money (Exclusive to the player), and their Weapon. Health
    is the ammount of hitpoints they have before reaching 0 and ending in a game over. Name is the name the creature, who would
    of guessed! Money currently serves no function beside braging rights and a sweet sweet number on the records screen.
    Weapon is the current weapon that the creature is weilding, you can only have one at a time. level is the base level that
    determinds your max health, unique to the player this level can change.
